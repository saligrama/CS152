# CS 152 - Trust and Safety Engineering
## Discord Bot Framework Code

This branch passes multiple messages around the user's last message concatenated to each other to our automated pipeline. 
This is to handle adversarial cases where the attacker is conveying a negative message word by word where each of the words 
or pieces of message might not be abusive on their own but in combination they are abusive.
